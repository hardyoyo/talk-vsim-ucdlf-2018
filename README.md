# VSim: Getting the job done with DSpace, while avoiding all the traps of customization

A short talk for UC-DLF, University of California, Riverside, February 27 - March 2, 2018

Abstract: This will be a brief case study of how UCLA Library customized an instance of DSpace 6x, to deliver all the business logic goals of the NEH-grant-funded VSim project, while avoiding making any major customization of DSpace internal code. We'll shine a spotlight on some code we borrowed from the DSpace community, and the ways we bent existing functionality to deliver a working repository of 3D Architectural models.
